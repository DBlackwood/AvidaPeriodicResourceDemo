This experiment will produce a single output file that gives the current
abundance of a set of resources over the course of the experiment.

Resources will be:

   - Global (non-spatial, non-cellular, non-gradient)
   - Have the same initial abundance, inflow rate, outflow rate


We will have N resources which vary by:

   - How often the inflow rate gets set to zero

We want to determine how the global resources respond to changes to inflow rate
adjustments to emulate seasonality.  This should be boring, but give us some
intuition about how values of inflow / outflow / timing map onto abundance
changes over time.

We will use this set of experiments as a template to see if spatial resources
(geometry set to GRID or TORUS) respond in a similar manner in the next set of
experiments.  We will not be evaluating GRADIENT resources at this time.  We
suspect that spatial resources (GRID/TORUS) may not respond to inflow changes in
the same manner (or even at all) using the SetResourceInflow action as the
action doesn't appear to adjust for cellular-based accounting (cSpatResCount).

We will use the actions:

   - PrintResourceData  #To print resource abundances
   - SetResourceInflow  #To adjust individual resource inflow rates
